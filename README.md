I currently do not encounter any more bugs when using the addon (trial account status, level 20), but whenever I sub again I will overhaul and fix the currency and travel module. I am not in a guild right now so updating the guild icon tooltip will have to wait.

Open to work on any proposed suggestions or issues right now until I sub again.
